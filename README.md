# Final Porject Proposal


## Project Overview
To create a comprehensive startup advisory system, the project will integrate data from CrunchBase, Yahoo Finance, real estate databases, e-commerce analytics, and government policy documents. The platform will analyze business domains, company size parameters, and location preferences to generate tailored recommendations and insights. Deliverables include a functional data pipeline for data ingestion, analytical models for AI-driven business analysis, and an interactive dashboard for seamless user experience.
